Facial Keypoints Detection


This repository contains the Facial Keypoint Detection project, which is the first project in the Computer Vision Nanodegree from Udacity.

The Facial Keypoint Detection project uses 6 layer LeNet style convolutional neural network (CNN) to find 68 facial keypoints on a face. Facial Keypoints are also called Facial Landmarks which generally specify the areas of the nose, eyes, mouth, etc on the face, classified by 68 key points, with coordinates (x, y), for that face. The keypoints are positioned on the features of a face, such as the eyebrow, nose, and mouth. The points could therefore be used in a number of applications including emotion detection and facial feature classification.

#Dataset:
Udacity provided YouTube Faces Dataset. It contains 3,425 face videos designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition in videos. These videos have been fed through processing steps and turned into sets of image frames containing one face and the associated keypoints.
